## Features in Detail

### Disease Prediction Algorithm
The application uses a symptom-based scoring system to predict diseases:
- Each animal type has a specific disease database
- Symptoms are matched against known disease patterns
- Confidence scores are calculated based on symptom matches
- Results include disease name, confidence level, and severity

### Supported Animals & Diseases

**Cattle**: Bovine Respiratory Disease, Mastitis, Foot and Mouth Disease, Bloat, Milk Fever
**Pigs**: Swine Flu, PRRS, Salmonellosis, Pneumonia
**Chickens**: Avian Influenza, Newcastle Disease, Coccidiosis, Fowl Pox

**Goats**: Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis, Pneumonia, Internal Parasites, Ketosis
**Horses**: Equine Influenza, Colic, Laminitis, Strangles
**Dogs**: Parvovirus, Distemper, Kennel Cough, Hip Dysplasia
**Cats**: Feline Leukemia, Upper Respiratory Infection, Feline Distemper, UTI

### Security Features
- File type validation for uploads
- File size limits (16MB maximum)
- Secure filename handling
- Input validation and sanitization
